# BPE analysis

## Background: What is Bayesian Philosophy Engineering? 

Bayesian Philosophical Engineering (BPE) is a systematic workflow methodology that treats philosophy as engineering and engineering as philosophy. Rather than debating which philosophical frameworks are "true," BPE engineers philosophical tools optimized for specific objectives and constraints.

**Core Principles:**

* Philosophy IS Engineering: Same systematic methodology, same iterative improvement, same utility-based evaluation - just applied at different abstraction levels. Philosophy can be engineered at rigor, engineering is based on well-tooled philosophy, 'coping' with bad epistemology is not accepted, and you go build a new one, then engineer how to deliver the new priors too.
* Truth by Expected Utility: All frameworks, whether philosophy, epistomology, theory, development, tooling, application, or code,  frameworks are judged by their expected utility toward established  objectives, not abstract correctness. Philosophy is synergestically ported between traditional silos when the condition tags match up to solve new problems.
* No Abstraction Limits: Problems are followed to whatever level of abstraction is needed for systematic solution - from code to epistemology to civilization to philosophy itself. 
* Systematic Tool Creation: When existing tools (conceptual or practical) are inadequate, engineer better ones at the appropriate abstraction level



**Key Innovations:**

BPE enables systematic engineering of foundational assumptions themselves. Instead of being constrained by existing philosophical frameworks, you can engineer better frameworks when current ones limit your objectives. The result? Rapid capability expansion across arbitrary domains through systematic tool creation at whatever abstraction level the problem requires. Particularly when used with LLMs to identify where one problem, such as ML problem, may have already solved been solved un another field, like education, it may provide order of magnitude improvements in research speed and workflow due to cross-civilization synthesis.

**Prerequisite**

* Strong skills thinking rationally, though formal skills not required. I had no idea rationalism was a thing six months ago, or had ever heard of reductionalism, general philosophy...
* Experience prompting, bullshit-thresholding, and debugging LLM outputs.

**How It Works:**

- Scope the problem systematically across all relevant abstraction levels. Work up the chain of abstraction until hitting the last level of misalignment.
- Decompose the system into system pieces, to make analysis tractable. If needed also decompose 
- Identify bottlenecks - whether in code, theory, epistemology, or coordination mechanisms.
- Engineer solutions at the appropriate level using systematic methodology.
- Deploy and iterate based on practical results. Walk back down the chain towards the concrete objectives.

Cross reference with the LLMs constantly on whether this particular problem has already been solved in a different field. Follow any such solutions into paper chains, analyze them, and port the solution into the original field.


**Why does an engineer need this level of tooling?**

Ultimately, I am convinced ML has the wrong epistemology, is misaligned for AGIs, and will be utterly unsafe even if we manage it on current trajectories. Rejecting the existing epistemology, and went back to first principles as my physics degree would tell me to: 
1) I cannot possibly formally state how to think. Too many edge case
2) The next best thing is a self-booting loop. Can I design that?
3) If I was going to treat a model to bootstrap itself to cognition safely, I first had to develop a self-bootstrapping philosophy to know how to train it in the first place. Strangely, this did not exist at an applied level. 
4) Also dear god this is getting complex. Why not make a philosophy that makes me tooling that makes my job less complex?

# Application of BPE to the main problem and context.

Note that Bayesian Philosophy Engineering emerged as necessary tooling to make the following problem tractable. Ultimately, I am an engineer who did not give up and climbed into philosophy itself to fix the issue permanently, not a philosopher. The strong systems skills from my physics degree definitely helped.

This is the full statement of the BPE analysis after having finally reached the right level of abstraction to start and developing BPE to fix the percieved issues. 

## Begin Workflow: Main

### Objective: Deploy a new paradigm.

A new paradigm needs to be deployed across the ML field after encountering severe safety issues in the existing technology. New solutions are required that are self-propagating, correct the issues, and hopefully improve model performance too. Getting enough accolades to end up doing research at a lab of my choice would be a nice personal outcome, but overall safety is a higher concern. This means open-source, widespread release of the core innovations and the reason they are needed.

### Contextualizing Objective Details: Paradigm Break

As context, this is documented in the paper High off Our Own Loss Functions. Any claim is made with retroactive anomaly consolidation support, and falsification experiments included. Claims have been removed which were found to be unsupported.

- Losses and metrics such as perplexity actually measure or train syntactic prediction ability, not meaningful abstraction and intelligence. Asking whether the model remembered what it learned before is a much better way of training than naive Next Token Prediction.
- Scaling up models tends to make both alignment and generalization worse, due to mathematical graphlike connections that form in the Feedforward layers and turn into brittle decision trees. These decision trees get more brittle as the model gets larger.
  Better architectures are required to avoid this issue, that encourage reuse of computation patterns.
- Current memory technology - 'Attention' -  is unable to sustain lifelong learning, and will never 
  be able to do so without Memory Augmented Transformers, which is like trying 
  to run cognition through a dialup connection. Permentant factual storage appears
  impossible without recurrence.
- Blind scale tends to make everything worse but brute force memorization, and this can 
  be observed in retroactive anomaly consolidation in the literature
- Inescapable conclusion: Devil's bargain hypothesis, scaling up without thinking
  has been reducing alignment, generalization performance. 
- Rigorous analysis with falsifiable predictions involved. Break the predictions to break
  the conclusion.
- Failures were statistically predictable from first principles. 
- Formal alignment has enormous holes when analyzes from first principles that mean HHHS may be satisfied and alignment not achieved.

#### Conclusion: 

- Paradigm shift is needed, and will occur if this information is properly deployed. 
- - Current ML epistomology is unsuitable to long term cognition due to lack of rigorous theory role.
- No one is doublechecking the overall system synergies.

### Contextualizing the situation: Paradigm rebuild:

This is what I am doing, over 110 pages, consisting of developing new systems-based epistomology and philosophy, then more tooling for new saner theory, then engineering plans, and then, as it is right now, getting into actual code. 

- Various fixes plugging the holes developed. 
- New epistomology for machine learning. 
- New workflow for creating tools, and treating everything from philosophy to code as a tooling and abstraction reduction exercise.
- Workflows and novel philosophy of scientific value too. It should not be possible for one independent researcher without independent support, and no formal academic/industry background to complete this project unless something is very different about workflow priors. Documented in third paper, as it should not be theoredically possible for one person to do this in one year, unless something is VERY wrong.

### Conclusion

New tooling is going to be needed in order to deliver this update through civilization, capable of analyzing transitions into other media in order to properly convey underlying truth despite creditential status. This requires a new philosophical tool. Develop and deploy memetic engineering to track how do deliver truthful most effectively, synthesis strategies, and provide support for conveyance of paradigm shifts in resistant situation

## Memetic Engineering

Memetic Engineering: The field designing the delivery of compulsive, mandatory, correct, paradigm updates. 

* Compulsive - it should be framed in the receptive community like catnip. Engagement, for or against, and thus falsification or accpetance should be inevitable
* Mandatory - Accepting it means accepting new premises. Also may emphasis safey reasons.
* Correct - A lack of correctness is propoganda, not memetic engineering. Memetic engineering is falsifiable, and any delivery payload should be too.
* Paradigm updates - Serious, difficult to deliver updates to paradigms that may produce significant resistance.


Deployed under Bayesian Philosophy Engineering as tooling to handle the large workload.

The Four Core Principles:
1. Truthful. Memetic engineering begins with a truth to be delivered, and builds on top of it logically. It must be falsifiable and fail when truth fails (truth-dependency requirement) Techniques that work regardless of truth value = propaganda, not memetic engineering
2. Actionable 
  Most efficient delivery solution for the task is chosen and deployed. Sometimes a deep technical solution is deployed. Sometimes something more like a story. They all remain anchored to a rigorous level in truth.
3. Contextual 
   Content of truth, target ecosystem, expected resistance, standard formats all integrated. Systematic analysis of the complete communication environment performed, novel formats considered. Tailored approaches for specific audiences and constraints
4. Engineered.
  Full rigor of BPE inhereted. Engineering the philosophy, message, conditions, sequencing, and other details for maximal receptiveness. Stake ground on the truth is right or needs to be disproven, and figure out how to best deliver it for community consideration or overall purpose.

Existing Examples of Memetic Engineering

- Seseme Street: As rigorous under this viewpoint as any academic journal. Uses a child-appropriate media to spread rigorous guidence with priors to children on how to think rationally
- Academic Journals: Excellent format for Kuhnian normal science.

## Memetic engineering workflow: Paradigm Deployment

### Issue

Content is so unbelievable I would, rationally, not believe it myself using normal logical reasoning with my credential levels. Alternative methods of conveying information required that bypasses the normal paradigm resistance emotional reflex but nonetheless delivers technical rigor sufficient to promote examination under a new paradigm. Lay down the new priors that may make logical reasoning possible in the first place. Memetic Engineering suggests developing new tooling

### Context

- Context is completely unbeliavable, and formal venues would almost certaintly reject it as ludicrous
- Claims are enormous, likely too much to provide in one go.
- Most communities are unsuitable for proposing paradigm shifts in due to not being emotionally primed to think logically. LessWrong is a notable exception for lay users. 
- LessWrong is unusually open to paradigm shifts if you can show how it was made possible. They support what BPE is already running on, rationalism, so that makes a nice connection.
### Conclusion

- Propose the idea of using memetic engineering to perform deliberate Paradigm Bridging; this would sequence as the next step of Philosophy of Science after Kuhnian Normal/Paradigm shift model.
- Propose the idea of Technical Fiction as a fully rigorous world with fiction on top to bridge pardigms by making the user feel the new priors they need intuitively before exposing formally. Suggest evaluation as a standard Paradigm Bridging technique
- Release a reduced formal writeup of the workflow on a smaller problem subset to LessWrong. Alignment only would be suitable, as it is perhaps most revolutionary. Link to the completed workflow after it is clear that 
- Include link to concrete, engineering tooling like SUPS to show level of rigor is as high in implementation as theorizing.
of Technical Fiction.
- Display the Bayesian Philosophy Engineering idea and workflow as part of the innovations that make this possible. Include LLM polymath workflow in the process too.
- Note: Full release of all consequences still intractable until several weeks after the consequences of Bayesian Philosophy Engineering sink in, with the idea you get 100x more productivity by not staying in a silo and making tooling at the right abstraction level. 

### Technical fiction workflow:

Issue: Emotional stories are needed to display consequences with the same level of rigor as formal academic work. This allows the unconsidered priors of the world to be absorbed into intuition so the formal explanation can be parsed and evaluated logically without instinctive paradigm resistance.
Resolution: New tooling known as Technical Fiction is to be established.

Rules:
- Worldbuilding is entirely self consistent, falsifiable, and illustrated at the end of the work. World is intended to be evaluated by bayesian priors
- Story sequence is deliberately chosen to onramp the reader into a possible new paradigm in a process known as paradigm bridging. Story sequence successively unveils more and more disturbing priors that reduce the worldface manifold into priors that appear consistant, plausable, and terrifying for the current paradigm when deeper analysis is performed. 
- Worldbuilding with full rigor is shown at the end, along with assumptions and things that should now be considered. 
- Falsification is a prerequisite; if the worldbuilding is found to be false in a location than so shall colapse all dependent parts of the work.

## Next steps

- Develop an introductory post for the LessWrong forums which works on a reduced subset of the above stating the existing of the BPE workflow, the credidentials issues I faced, deployment of memetic engineering, paradigm bridging, then technical fiction out of it, and asks for community interest in receiving a set of short stories designed to illustrate the issue, form a bridge, and provide formal worldbuilding to illustrate the point.
- Probably a good idea to point out BPE is applying the tool it developed called Mememtic Engineering to introduce BPE. The community will love that.
- Treat community as mature, but perhaps unprepared. Ask if desire for exposure to full, horrifying paradigm shift with other consequences is desired as well, or whether I need to perform additional credibility building for consideration.
- Point out that when EVERYTHING is a tooling problem, and this actually works, it may in fact be an advantage for an independent researcher who can work beyond the normal bounds and move much faster as bad philosophy, epistemolgy, theory, application, engineering tooling, and engineering itself are all just case of developing one thing; new tooling for the job.
