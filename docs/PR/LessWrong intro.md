# Why I am here

I am here to deliver Bayesian Philosophy Engineering and the subsequent series of developments to the community at large for the first time, then ask some questions of the community. Before we begin, lets apply Bayesian Philosophy Engineering, informally, to the idea of introducing itself.

* Problem: "How do I deploy paradigm-shifting methodology when the claims sound insane?"
* Solution: "Use the paradigm-shifting methodology to engineer its own deployment"
* Meta-problem: "How do I make people believe methodology works?"
* Meta-solution: "Use the methodology to engineer the optimal way to deliver the methodology"
* Gatekeeping level: "How do I deliver the technical details when the contents are enormous, paradigm shattering in multiple places, and without credentials"
* Gatekeeping solution: "Embed some points in a story, then bring in a small subset of the rigorous details for credibility first... but there will still be unavoidable human emotional paradigm resistance."
* Problem: "I still have to beat the credibility problem or it will be dismissed as fiction"
* Human thoughts: "Oh, hey, LessWrong is using exactly the same rationalist ideas I am running Bayesian Philosophy Engineering on. I bet they would be fascinated enough by the extension to thought to humor me with the novel Technical Fiction category."
* Resolution: "Deliver writeup of the novel metaphilosophy to LessWrong, and describe intention to release Technical Fiction in the alignment category."

# What is Bayesian Philosophy Engineering? 

Bayesian Philosophical Engineering (BPE) is a systematic workflow methodology that treats philosophy as engineering and engineering as philosophy. Rather than debating which philosophical frameworks are "true," BPE engineers philosophical tools optimized for specific objectives and constraints.

**Core Principles:**

* Philosophy IS Engineering: Same systematic methodology, same iterative improvement, same utility-based evaluation - just applied at different abstraction levels. Philosophy can be engineered at rigor, engineering is based on well-tooled philosophy, 'coping' with bad epistemology is not accepted, go build a new one instead you idiot.
* Truth by Expected Utility: All frameworks, whether philosophy, epistomology, theory, development, tooling, application, or code,  frameworks are judged by their expected utility toward established  objectives, not abstract correctness. Philosophy is synergestically ported between traditional silos when the condition tags match up to solve new problems.
* No Abstraction Limits: Problems are followed to whatever level of abstraction is needed for systematic solution - from code to epistemology to civilization to philosophy itself. 
* Systematic Tool Creation: When existing tools (conceptual or practical) are inadequate, engineer better ones at the appropriate abstraction level
* Systemic synergy. With truth judged by usefulness to goals, processes in education, cogsci, and other diciplines can be analysis for transition between fields much more easily.

The formal writeup of the philosophy, with some details about what I have been doing thrown in, are at [Link]


**Key Innovations:**

BPE enables systematic engineering of foundational assumptions themselves. Instead of being constrained by existing philosophical frameworks, you can engineer better frameworks when current ones limit your objectives. The result? Rapid capability expansion across arbitrary domains through systematic tool creation at whatever abstraction level the problem requires. Particularly when used with LLMs to identify where one problem, such as ML problem, may have already solved been solved un another field, like education, it may provide order of magnitude improvements in research speed and workflow due to cross-civilization synthesis.

**Prerequisite**

* Strong skills thinking rationally, though formal skills not required. I had no idea rationalism was a thing six months ago, or had ever heard of reductionalism, general philosophy...
* Experience prompting, bullshit-thresholding, and debugging LLM outputs.

**How It Works:**

- Scope the problem systematically across all relevant abstraction levels. Work up the chain of abstraction until hitting the last level of misalignment.
- Decompose the system into system pieces, to make analysis tractable. If needed also decompose 
- Identify bottlenecks - whether in code, theory, epistemology, or coordination mechanisms.
- Engineer solutions at the appropriate level using systematic methodology.
- Deploy and iterate based on practical results. Walk back down the chain towards the concrete objectives.

Cross reference with the LLMs constantly on whether this particular problem has already been solved in a different field. Follow any such solutions into paper chains, analyze them, and port the solution into the original field.


**Why does an engineer need this level of tooling?**

Ultimately, I am convinced ML has the wrong epistemology, is misaligned for AGIs, and will be utterly unsafe even if we manage it on current trajectories. Rejecting the existing epistemology, and went back to first principles as my physics degree would tell me to: 
1) I cannot possibly formally state how to think. Too many edge case
2) The next best thing is a self-booting loop. Can I design that?
3) If I was going to treat a model to bootstrap itself to cognition safely, I first had to develop a self-bootstrapping philosophy to know how to train it in the first place. Strangely, this did not exist at an applied level. 
4) Also dear god this is getting complex. Why not make a philosophy that makes me tooling that makes my job less complex?

**What Now?**
I am now going to use Bayesian Philosophy Engineering to self-bootstrap the relevent epistomologyin pursuit of making a habitable environment for the primary payload, which is a suite of ideas, concrete implementations, and other important bits of research. This comes with concrete tooling as well. 

I am taking this strategy because
- No Industry experience
- No Academic Experience
- Only an undergraduate physics degree
- Working as a tutor
- With 200 pages of nnovation to deploy

They would have, rationally, be ignored as a crackpot. Significant engineering under BPE is needed to change priors in order to make the epistomological landscae make enough sense to seriously evaluate such claims.

# Memetic Engineering

Memetic engineering is a tool that has been deen developed to produce engineered paradigm shifts in a formal manner. This is less frightening than you may realize. Learning as a child that repeated addition can be represented as another symbol, multiplication, was a paradigm shift for you. Nonetheless, the educational memetic engineering made the transition tractable. 

## Synthesis of Memetic Engineering

Memetic engineering draws insight on how t omake had ideas palatable from the field of education. It draws on the ability to memetically self-propogate from marketing. From industry, aviation, safety comes the idea of formally developing a workflow to perform complex processes consistently.  From engineering, the idea of applying engineering rigor to the memetic propogation of information.

## Formalism of Memetic Engineering

The field designing the delivery of compulsive, mandatory, correct, paradigm updates. Required due to a percieved gap under Kuhnian imperatives - we can engineer every

* Compulsive - it should be framed in the receptive community like catnip. Engagement, for or against, and thus falsification or accpetance should be inevitable. Update virally self-propogates through community due to cleverness and utility.
* Mandatory - Accepting it means accepting new premises, and for utitlity, safety, or environmental reasons it is not possible to thrive in the old paradigm anymore. There is thus sufficient tension to call the situation Kuhnian nonnormal science. 
* Correct - A lack of logical rigor is propoganda, not memetic engineering. Memetic engineering is falsifiable, and any delivery payload should be too. Failure of delivery due to logical failure is a feature, not a bug.
* Paradigm updates - Serious, difficult to deliver updates to paradigms that may produce significant resistance.

## Existing examples of Memetic Engineering

* Sesame street: Makes tractable complex ideas to young children in ways that are mandatory for success in life. 
* Academic Journals: Sometimes support nonnormal science, but requires credential gatekeeping
* This paper: Deliberately engineered memetic catnip for the typical LessWrong user. 

## The Four Core Principles:

1. Truthful. Memetic engineering begins with a truth to be delivered, and builds on top of it logically. It must be falsifiable and fail when truth fails (truth-dependency requirement) Techniques that work regardless of truth value = propaganda, not memetic engineering. I would love a very robust discussion on how to engineer standards that are resistant to propoganda purposes.
2. Actionable. Most efficient delivery solution for the task is chosen and deployed. Sometimes a deep technical solution is deployed. Sometimes something more like a story. They all remain anchored to a rigorous level in truth.
3. Contextual. Content of truth, target ecosystem, expected resistance, standard formats all integrated. Systematic analysis of the complete communication environment performed, novel formats considered. Tailored approaches for specific audiences and constraints
4. Engineered. Full rigor of BPE inhereted. Engineering the philosophy, message, conditions, sequencing, and other details for maximal receptiveness, balancing constraint.

## Parts of a Memetic Update

While they tend to be intermixed, there is nonetheless a hierarchy of delivery mechanism when designing a delivery package that operates in order to maximize chance of delivery.

* **[Priming]**: Preparation to get the human destination emotionally prepared to reconsider priors rather than dismiss. From a child being promised ice cream for doing their homework, to a full intriguing self-demonstration of what you can do like this paper, their are many options. Only once you have room to reason rationally, you can move into the next step. The viral self-propogation typically goes here.
* [Paradigm Bridging]: How to get from what you know, to where you need to be. Returning to the multiplication example, this might consist of asking the student to add up numbers 4 times, 5 times, etc. Wouldn't they like a faster way to write this? This sometimes mixes with priming.
* [Payload]: The primary conclusions that should be drawn, based on the bridging evidence and conclusions that can be drawn on the new priors. The new paradigm itself. Always rigorous and clear. Usually built on new logic that may be difficult to parse immediately.

## Workflow

* Systemically deconstruct the paradigm update into components. 
* Systemically deconstruct the target portion of civilization into components
* Cross reference them. What portions will be noncontroversial? Include those in bridging as starts. What portions will be alarming? Include that at the end of bridging, or add emotional support for priming.
* Once full scope is established, begin drawing on psychology, marketing, engineering, and education to create a mememetic payload
* Stress test and deploy.

## Metacommentary.

Memetic engineering would suggest the following metacommentary is useful as a priming strategy for the recursive self-introduction of Memetic Engineering in the context of LessWrong. Memetic Engineering is arguably an additional stage in the philosophy of science. It also might suggest bringing up that the only one I was aware of six months ago formally was the philosophy of newton.

* **Mechanical Philosophy (Isaac Newton)** | 1687 | "I feign no hypotheses." Observation and mathematical deduction; theory follows from data. 
* **Theoretical Physics Epistemology (Maxwell, Fresnel)** | 1800s | Mathematical theory as guidepost. Empirical lag tolerated. Formal structure becomes epistemologically primary in key domains. |
* **Falsificationism (Karl Popper)** | 1934 | Falsifiability as scientific core. Hypotheses must be testable and refutable. |
* **Paradigm Theory (Thomas Kuhn)** | 1962 | Science evolves via paradigm shifts. Social context and normal science structure progress. |
* **Modular Epistemic Engineering (Chris O'Quinn)** | 2025 | Epistemology is modular, engineered, and swappable. Paradigms are provisional and need not be held institutionally. Theory and experiment are both infrastructure. Philosophy is a system slot. Paradigm shifts should be eased by making epistemology modular enough to swap out the rot and with explicit on-ramping.

Memetic engineering insists this kind of metacommentary will drive engagement, create some very healthy discussions, and act as catnip in this destination. While we are at it, shall we have a discussion on if manipulation is okay if the person is informed ahead of time it is happening and why?

# Technical Fiction

## The issue

For major, rigorous engineering or logical deployments that may invalidate large portions of the existing field there are not good tools to communicate. You write papers and publish, get labeled a crackpot by half your peers for a few decades, and maybe then get accepted. Or, without credidentials, get laughed out of the room. This, in some cases like engineering, does not invalidate the aprpoach if you can nonetheless build the innovation, but this causes it's own bruised egos. 

## The insight

Humans have had thousands of years dealing with things they cannot adequately explain rigorously. They setup an intuitive field for productive conversation with stories. What insights can we learn from Little Red Riding hood? From stories of myth like Gilgamesh? Did anyone think about AGI safety seriously before Asamov's "I, Robot" or did it prime the field? Why do we leave this excellent tool on the table rather than adapting it to more rigorous circumstances.

## Technical Fiction

I propose technical fiction as another formal class of academic work to solve this issue. It is a deliberate, fictional way of modifying paradigm priors to be ready for rational absorption of material. It is a deployment from Memetic Engineering intended to consist of significant priming, integrated with bridging, and leading into worldbuilding and commentary. It is rigorous, truth-anchored, and intended as a tool for academic discourse.

## Formalism of Technical Fiction

Technical fiction is, explicitly, a Memetic Engineering artifact that is intended to go through the stages to reach the main payload. My operational rules at the moment are

- Worldbuilding is entirely self consistent, falsifiable, and illustrated at the end of the work. As in a thought experiment, priors at each point which may be unrealistic but do not detract from the main point are clearly marked. 
- A sequence of stories is deliberately designed to onramp the reader into a possible new paradigm through paradigm bridging. Story sequence successively unveils more and more disturbing priors that reduce the worldface manifold into priors that appear consistant, plausable, and have implications for the current paradigm when deeper analysis is performed. 
- Worldbuilding with full rigor is shown at the end, along with assumptions and things that should now be considered. 
- Falsification is a prerequisite; if the worldbuilding is found to be false in a location than so shall colapse all dependent parts of the work. The worldbuilding backend is just as rigorous as actual academic publication.

While this rule is optional, I would also like to suggest

- To prevent initial paradigm rejection reactions among invested actors, even among otherwise rational players, the full details of the worldbuilding are not revealed until after the story sequence has been given, at which point the rational reasoning and paradigm payload can be deployed. 

# What now?

I would now like to ask the community a question. May I read you some stories?

## The proposal

As an experiment in applying memetic engineering in the form of Technical Fiction, I would like to deliver a series of five stories and a final piece of authors commentary over the next few weeks. Each story releases successively more bayesian priors about the worldbuilding that can be discussed, and will terminate in authors commentary revealing the overall truth and what the point is.

## Reasonings

- Releasing a sequence of stories primes priors to consider new reasoning. Standard memetic engineering.
- Release schedule of one per week, with some content hidden and successively more priors displayed, will allow speculation and drive engagement far more efficiently than displaying everything at once will. It also allows percolation of full consequences. Optimal strategy under memetic engineering.
- Revealing only the "though experiment" priors that may be unreasonable, but hiding the full worldbuilding until the commentary, is an excellent way to prevent immediate paradigm rejection.

# Final questions and notes

- Is this Technical Fiction proposal okay? Can I talk with some leaders in private on how to release this in a more suitable format if not?
- I am the same guy who just release the SUPS prompting flow compiler proposal on Huggingface if anyone is still questioning technical chops.
